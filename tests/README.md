# lore-framework tests

Tests for the `lore-framework` plugin. They live here in the **dev repo**, not in the plugin repo,
which stays slim for marketplace distribution (see `lore-framework/docs/conventions.md` §
Dev-Only Artifacts and the `plugin-vs-agent-repo-separation` lore principle).

## Running

Strategy docs:

- [`testing-strategy.md`](testing-strategy.md) — whole test suite strategy and release-gate policy.
- [`quality/strategy.md`](quality/strategy.md) — detailed quality benchmark strategy.
- [`quality/reporting.md`](quality/reporting.md) — quality report field guide and column glossary.

Stdlib only — no pytest, no install.

```bash
python3 tests/test_wait.py -v
python3 tests/test_session_takeover.py -v
# or
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Locating the plugin

Tests find the plugin under test via `$LR_FRAMEWORK_DIR`, defaulting to the sibling
`../lore-framework`. Override if your layout differs:

```bash
LR_FRAMEWORK_DIR=/path/to/lore-framework python3 tests/test_wait.py -v
```

## Suites

- **`test_wait.py`**
  - `TestUnit` — pure helpers of `scripts/wait-server.py`: inbox resolution, match ordering by
    arrival time, the by-name prefix boundary (`deploy` ≠ `deployment`), `consume`→`processed/`,
    mode selection, and timeout/sleep timing. Loads the hyphenated server file via `importlib`.
  - `TestIntegration` — a live `wait-server.py` subprocess driven over real JSON-RPC stdio, plus the
    real `scripts/lr-emit`: handshake, `tools/list`, `sleep`, timeout, `one`/`all`, by-name,
    blocking-wake, and EOF shutdown.

## Lifecycle scenario tests (Layer 3)

- **`test_session_takeover.py`**
  - Cursor takeover conversion: synthetic `CURSOR_HOME` fixture, JSONL + `store.db` batch-window
    tool-result pairing, `.db` → JSONL redirect, uuid resolution.

`lifecycle/` holds end-to-end scenario tests: a throwaway fixture workspace (agent repo +
local bare `origin`, zero network) is built per test, a real engine runs a lifecycle prompt
headless in it, and a script asserts on the resulting files and git state. Design and full
scenario catalog: lore-architect `workdir/draft-testing-pipeline.md`.

**They call a real engine and cost API money**, so they are gated — skipped unless
`LR_LIFECYCLE=1`:

```bash
LR_LIFECYCLE=1 python3 tests/lifecycle/test_boot.py -v          # all boot scenarios
LR_LIFECYCLE=1 python3 tests/lifecycle/test_boot.py -v -k 01    # one scenario
```

Env knobs: `LR_ENGINE` (default `claude`; supported: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`),
`LR_TEST_MODEL` (overrides the cheapest per-engine default: claude -> haiku,
codex -> gpt-5.4-mini, cursor -> composer-2.5), `LR_RUN_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default 420),
`LR_FRAMEWORK_DIR` (as above). For debugging real-engine variance, set `LR_KEEP_FIXTURES=1`
to keep throwaway workspaces and `LR_DEBUG_DIR=/path/to/debug` to dump each run's final
message and stderr tail.
In CI, provide engine auth (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and set `LR_LIFECYCLE=1`; run
nightly/on-demand, not per-commit.

For release gates, prefer the lifecycle matrix runner so each engine/module result is recorded
under `tests/lifecycle/results/`:

```bash
python3 tests/lifecycle/run_matrix.py --dry-run
LR_LIFECYCLE=1 python3 tests/lifecycle/run_matrix.py --engine-jobs 3 --module-jobs 1
LR_LIFECYCLE=1 python3 tests/lifecycle/run_matrix.py --engines claude --modules test_finalize.py
```

The runner defaults to the cheapest per-engine models already used by the harness
(claude -> haiku, codex -> gpt-5.4-mini, cursor -> composer-2.5). Engines may run in parallel by
default; modules within one engine stay serial unless `--module-jobs` is raised, avoiding avoidable
quota bursts. It writes `summary.json`, per-module stdout/stderr logs, and `LR_DEBUG_DIR` captures
inside the run directory.

## Keeper lifecycle scenarios (Layer 3, Being Keeper)

- **`lifecycle/test_lrb_lifecycle.py`** + **`lifecycle/keeper_harness.py`**
  — real-engine scenarios for the Being Keeper (`lrb`, `lore-framework/scripts/lrb.py`), covering
  what only a real engine subprocess can prove (real argv, real headless result-JSON shape, real
  cost fields, real process trees to kill, real `ps` output to parse identity from). Deliberately
  does **not** re-cover scheduling math, budget gating, outbox validation, or PID-identity *logic*
  — those are already exercised deterministically and at zero cost by `test_lrb.py`'s stub-engine
  suite. Design: lore-architect `workdir/draft-lrb-lifecycle-tests.md`.

  **Gated separately from `LR_LIFECYCLE`: `LR_LIFECYCLE_KEEPER=1`.** Keeper scenarios have a
  strictly higher blast-radius class than "one headless call that costs money" — some spawn a real
  background process (a real process tree to kill, or a real `lrb daemon` subprocess) that could
  outlive a naive test. Every scenario sandboxes `$LRB_HOME`/`$LRB_LAUNCHAGENTS_DIR` into a
  throwaway tempdir and guarantees teardown of anything real it spawned, even on assertion failure
  — never touches the real machine's `~/.lore-beings` or loads a real `launchd` job.

  ```bash
  LR_LIFECYCLE_KEEPER=1 LR_ENGINE=claude python3 tests/lifecycle/test_lrb_lifecycle.py -v
  LR_LIFECYCLE_KEEPER=1 LR_ENGINE=codex  python3 tests/lifecycle/test_lrb_lifecycle.py -v -k a2
  LR_LIFECYCLE_KEEPER=1 LR_ENGINE=cursor python3 tests/lifecycle/test_lrb_lifecycle.py -v -k a3
  ```

  Same env knobs as the framework's own lifecycle suite (`LR_FRAMEWORK_DIR`, `LR_RUN_TIMEOUT`,
  `LR_KEEP_FIXTURES`, `LR_DEBUG_DIR`), plus `LR_ENGINE` selects which single engine's scenarios run
  (claude-only scenarios skip cleanly under `LR_ENGINE=codex`/`=cursor`) and `LR_TEST_MODEL`
  overrides the per-engine cheapest-model default (`MODEL_DEFAULTS` in `keeper_harness.py`: claude
  → haiku, codex → gpt-5.4-mini, cursor → composer-2.5).

  **Hard prerequisite:** run on a real shell with a working `ps` binary — a sandboxed environment
  that blocks `ps` forces every PID-identity check down the "unknown" branch and can't exercise the
  confirmed-match logic the D1 scenario exists to prove (see `macos-ps-o-multi-field-single-line.md`).

  11 of the design's 13 scenarios:

  | # | Scenario | Engine kind(s) | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | A1 | Core loop: existential task fires → real spawn → cost charged → ledger `ok` | claude | ✅ |
  | A2 | Core loop: codex JSONL `turn.completed` parsed, flat cost charged | codex | ✅ |
  | A3 | Core loop: cursor claude-shaped JSON parsed, real cost charged | cursor | ✅ |
  | B1 | Timeout kill takes down the real process tree (grandchildren too) | claude | ✅ |
  | B2 | Same as B1 — proves codex's own shell tool spawns a real, killable subprocess tree | codex | ✅ |
  | B3 | Same as B1 — proves cursor's own shell tool spawns a real, killable subprocess tree | cursor | ✅ |
  | C1 | Self-scheduling round trip via real `lrb schedule` invocation | claude | ✅ |
  | C4 | Self-scheduling denied under `permission_mode: default` — no hang, no silent success | claude | ✅ |
  | D1 | Real PID-identity confirmed-match against a real engine's `ps` output | claude | ✅ |
  | E1 | Real `lrb daemon` subprocess: daemon.lock, SIGTERM shutdown, lock release | claude | ✅ (PATH-under-launchd/M7 minimal-PATH probe deliberately out of scope — see file docstring) |
  | D2/D3 | Same as D1, codex/cursor | codex, cursor | deferred — `_pid_identity`'s `ps` call is pure OS-level process inspection, independent of which engine spawned the PID, so D1's claude proof is representative (unlike B1, which B2/B3 proved was NOT safe to assume) |

## Quality benchmark (Layer: lore utilization)

`quality/` measures whether an agent's lore actually improves its output. Each probe plants a
"needle" fact in a fixture agent's lore, runs the agent on a task where that fact should change
the answer, and scores three stages — S1 retrieval, S2 grounding, S3 application (LLM judge) —
across a treatment arm (fact present) and a control arm (fact removed). The headline number is
**behavior uplift**: S3 pass-rate(treatment) − S3 pass-rate(control).

Quality strategy: `quality/strategy.md`. Report field guide: `quality/reporting.md` explains the
terms and columns used in matrix reports and release-note blocks.

Gated behind `LR_QUALITY=1` (real engine calls, costs money). Two ways to run:

**Single config** — one engine/model, probe×arm parallel inside (`LR_QUALITY_JOBS`, default 3):

```bash
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/test_quality.py -v                     # claude:haiku
LR_QUALITY=1 LR_ENGINE=codex python3 tests/quality/test_quality.py -v     # codex:gpt-5.4-mini
```

`LR_TEST_MODEL` overrides the model; unset, it defaults to the engine's regular model
(claude:haiku, codex:gpt-5.4-mini, cursor:composer-2.5).

**Matrix** — `run_matrix.py` drives many configs in parallel, each an isolated
`test_quality.py` subprocess, across two concurrency axes:

```bash
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py                            # regular, defaults (ship gate)
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --matrix deep --model-jobs 3
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --matrix deep --skip codex
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --model claude=opus-4.8
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --configs claude:haiku,claude:opus-4.8
LR_QUALITY=1 python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --configs codex:gpt-5.4-mini --probes P4-paraphrase-recall,P10-parametric-gotcha --arms control
python3 tests/quality/run_matrix.py --matrix deep --dry-run                 # plan only, no spend
```

**Tiers.** `--matrix regular` (the default — a bare `run_matrix.py` runs it) is one
representative "cheapest usable" model per engine; it's the per-release ship gate. `--matrix
deep` is the full engine×model matrix, run only on explicit request (expensive). The tier tables
are canonical defaults in `quality/harness.py` (`REGULAR_MODEL`, `DEEP_MODELS`, `ENGINE_ORDER`),
so a fresh checkout / CI release always resolves to the same default set.

**Configuring the tiers.** For persistent personal reconfiguration without editing code or
affecting releases, drop a git-ignored `quality/matrix-config.local.json` beside the harness:

```json
{ "engine_order": ["claude", "cursor"],
  "regular": {"claude": "opus-4.8"},
  "deep": {"claude": ["sonnet", "opus-4.8"]} }
```

Its keys layer over the defaults — `engine_order` (list) replaces the engine set; `regular`
(engine→model) and `deep` (engine→[models]) update per-engine entries. `--no-local-config` (or
`LR_QUALITY_NO_LOCAL=1`) ignores the file and forces the canonical defaults — **this is what a
release ship gate uses, so ships always pick up the default set regardless of any local file.**
Per-run overrides need no file: `--model claude=opus-4.8` (swap one engine's model), `--configs`
(any explicit set), `--skip`/`--only` (drop/keep engines or `engine:model` pairs). For targeted
reruns, `--probes` and `--arms` filter the probe ids and treatment/control arms inside each
selected config; the same filters are available directly through `LR_QUALITY_PROBES` and
`LR_QUALITY_ARMS` for `test_quality.py`.

**Concurrency.**
- `--engine-jobs N` — engines in parallel (default: all; different engines hit different token
  pools, so cross-engine parallelism is free).
- `--model-jobs N` — models of one engine in parallel (default: 1/sequential; models share an
  engine's token pool, so parallelizing them is what risks token/rate exhaustion).

**Failure tolerance.** A probe-arm row that fails technically (engine timeout, provider/account
error, non-zero engine exit, or judge outage) is recorded as `technical_failure` and excluded from
the affected scoring stage; the engine/model config is marked `partial`, and LUS/S3 rates are
computed from fully scored rows with coverage counts shown beside them. A config is `failed` only
when it cannot produce any usable score artifact. The runner exits non-zero only for `failed`
configs; `partial` configs are valid incomplete benchmark evidence. `--skip`ped configs do not
count against the exit code. Per-config JSON lands in `quality/results/`; the runner prints each
scorecard plus a matrix summary.

**Execution records.** `run_matrix.py` writes one durable run directory under
`quality/results/matrix-<timestamp>-<matrix>/`:

- `summary.json` — machine-readable ledger: command, timestamps, wall time, framework/dev repo
  SHAs and dirty flags, selected configs, skips, status, per-config durations, log paths,
  per-config result paths, known cost totals, unavailable-cost counts, technical failures, and
  rerun commands.
- `summary.md` — operator-facing run summary with artifacts and rerun commands.
- `release-notes.md` — paste-ready release-note section, wrapped in stable
  `<!-- lr-quality-report:start ... -->` / `<!-- lr-quality-report:end ... -->` markers so a later
  release process can extract or replace it mechanically. It carries the compact visual matrix
  (status, engine completion, fully scored completion, engine/judge technical-failure split,
  treatment/control LUS, treatment/control S3, uplift, cost, time), a grouped technical-failure
  category table, and exact failed-subset rerun commands. LUS is still reported when S3 judging is
  unavailable, so incomplete configs remain scoreable and visually distinct from rows the engine
  never completed. Each generated report links back to `tests/quality/reporting.md` as the field
  guide for these terms.
- `logs/*.stdout.txt` / `logs/*.stderr.txt` — raw subprocess output per engine/model.
- `configs/quality-*.json` — the per-config score JSON from `test_quality.py`.

Cost is split into agent-run cost and judge-call cost. Engines that do not expose USD stay marked
unavailable; the runner reports known spend plus an unavailable-field count rather than guessing.
`test_quality.py` also writes its per-config JSON on engine failure before raising, so failed
configs can be diagnosed and rerun from the matrix summary.
